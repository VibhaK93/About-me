### ðŸ‘‹ Hi â€” I'm Vibhashree 

With 3+ years of experience transforming noisy data into business-critical insights, Iâ€™ve worked on analytics initiatives across industries â€” from luxury retail with Sephora to autism care with Centria Healthcare. Whether Iâ€™m building dashboards viewed by VPs or mapping data architectures for marketing transformation, my goal remains the same: make data not just readable, but actionable.

My strength lies at the intersection of marketing strategy and data analytics. Iâ€™ve architected marketing performance dashboards used to personalize campaigns at scale, automated sales reporting workflows for $60M+ revenue pipelines, and defined data governance frameworks to eliminate inconsistencies and siloed truths. From SQL logic to Power BI storytelling to stakeholder workshops, Iâ€™m fluent in the full lifecycle of data-driven decision making.Whether it's reducing reporting effort by 5+ hours/week through automation, or increasing behavior technician performance by 25% through clinical quality analytics, I thrive in high-impact environments where data clarity becomes a competitive advantage.

Before diving into data pipelines and performance dashboards, I began my journey at the intersection of business development and analysis, solving real-world challenges with a strategic and hands-on approach. At IIMT Studies, I led the transformation of an E-learning platform, boosting student engagement by 30% through process improvements, KPI-led decision-making, and strategic adoption of digital tools. Before that, at Potenza Global Solutions, I transitioned into a dual role as Business Analyst and Project Manager, where I successfully delivered 30+ tech projects. I specialized in translating complex client needs into structured requirements, agile sprints, wireframes, and ultimately, scalable digital solutions that drove measurable business outcomes. 

That foundationâ€”rooted in business strategy, stakeholder management, and process improvementâ€”laid the groundwork towards my analytical journey.

With dual Masterâ€™s degrees in Information Systems and Marketing, I bridge both the business why and the technical how â€” helping teams unlock insights, streamline execution, and scale smarter.

Letâ€™s connect if you're looking for someone who can bring structure to data chaos and turn performance questions into measurable results.
