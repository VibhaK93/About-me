### 👋 Hi — I'm Vibhashree 

With 3+ years of experience transforming noisy data into business-critical insights, I’ve worked on analytics initiatives across industries — from luxury retail with Sephora to autism care with Centria Healthcare. Whether I’m building dashboards viewed by VPs or mapping data architectures for marketing transformation, my goal remains the same: make data not just readable, but actionable.

My strength lies at the intersection of marketing strategy and data analytics. I’ve architected marketing performance dashboards used to personalize campaigns at scale, automated sales reporting workflows for $60M+ revenue pipelines, and defined data governance frameworks to eliminate inconsistencies and siloed truths. From SQL logic to Power BI storytelling to stakeholder workshops, I’m fluent in the full lifecycle of data-driven decision making.Whether it's reducing reporting effort by 5+ hours/week through automation, or increasing behavior technician performance by 25% through clinical quality analytics, I thrive in high-impact environments where data clarity becomes a competitive advantage.

Before diving into data pipelines and performance dashboards, I started my journey solving business challenges on the front lines of Business development. At IIMT Studies, I helped lead the transformation of an E-learning platform, driving a 30% increase in student engagement through better processes, new tool adoption strategies, and KPI-driven insight. At Potenza Global Solutions, I delivered 30+ tech projects as a Business Analyst and Project Manager, transforming ambiguous client requirements into agile sprints, wireframes, and revenue-generating applications.

That foundation—rooted in business strategy, stakeholder management, and process improvement—laid the groundwork towards my analytical journey.

With dual Master’s degrees in Information Systems and Marketing, I bridge both the business why and the technical how — helping teams unlock insights, streamline execution, and scale smarter.

Let’s connect if you're looking for someone who can bring structure to data chaos, and turn performance questions into measurable results.
